# CloneHero Referee Tool
 Simple app to keep track and build a text report when reffing in CloneHero tournaments.

Referees typically need to type everything out to keep track of the current match. Instead, this tool only requires that you type out the group letter and names of the players. Everything else is handled via drop-downs. There is also a button to save a screenshot to a designated match folder.

Setlists are stored in the included INI file, which can easily be edited to include new setlists following the format of the existing setlists. The INI file is included in the release, however, the ini may be updated without a new release, in which case you will need to manually download it for updates. After running once, you will be able to see and edit the INI file.

This is a universal tool, but follows CSC format standards.

# Limitations
Due to the very simple UI choice, on a 1080 monitor with no DPI scaling, a maximum of 20 songs can be added before running off the screen. Most tournaments are best of 7 or 9, so this isn't a real issue.
